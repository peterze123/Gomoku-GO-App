# Gomoku-GO-App
- #### Go mode has not been implemented
- Start the game by simply pressing start, the player holding black can place the stone
- Note that after a game is finished (white or black had won), start had to be pressed again
- But after pressing reset, you don't have to click start again; the game would automatically start and the black can place the stone
 - Gomoku: a game also known as five-in-a-row. See this video for how to play the game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KD743yNDHc
